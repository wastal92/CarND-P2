# Traffic Signs Recognition
---
**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
- Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
- Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
- Design, train and test a model architecture
- Use the model to make predictions on new images
- Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
- Summarize the results with a written report

### Data Set Summary & Exploration
1. Data Set Summary
First, I downloaded the data set from [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip) and then extracted it. The data set includes three sets: **train.p** for training, **valid.p** for validation and **test.p** for test.The train, validation and test set contain 34799, 4410 and 12630 examples respectively. The size of each example is /theta in width and height. There are 43 unique classes for the entire sets.

2. Exploratory visualization of the dataset
Here is an exploratory visualization of the train data set. Each number in the horizontal axis represents a class and the vertical axis stand for the number of examples in corresponding class.
